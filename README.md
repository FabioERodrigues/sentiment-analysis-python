Technical Details

Backend: Flask web framework
ML Framework: TensorFlow and Hugging Face Transformers
Model: Fine-tuned BERT for sequence classification
Data Visualization: Matplotlib and WordCloud
Frontend: Bootstrap 5 for responsive design

Data Processing Pipeline

Upload: User uploads a CSV or Excel file
Text Selection: User selects the column containing text data
Preprocessing: Text is cleaned (URLs, mentions, punctuation removed)
Model Inference: BERT model classifies each text as positive (1) or negative (0)
Visualization: Generate charts based on analysis results
Results: Display sample results and offer full download

Customization

Model: Replace the BERT model in the models/best_bert_model directory with any compatible TFBertForSequenceClassification model
UI: Modify the HTML templates in the templates directory to change the user interface
Processing: Adjust text cleaning and preprocessing in the clean_text() function

Troubleshooting

Model Loading Error: Ensure you have the correct model files in the models/best_bert_model directory
Memory Issues: For large datasets, consider processing in batches or increasing the server memory
TensorFlow Warnings: The app disables oneDNN optimizations by default to avoid common warnings

# sentiment-analysis-python
Latency and accuracy analysis of deep learning vs traditional sentiment analysis models.

This project contains two parts the research part which involves benchmarking latency and accuracy of traditional machine learning against BERT based models and the second part is the BERT sentiment analysis Web application.

Part 1 - Latency and accuracy of traditional machine learning against BERT based models



Part 2 -# BERT Sentiment Analysis Web Application

A Flask-based web application that performs sentiment analysis on text data using a pre-trained BERT model.

## Overview

This application allows users to upload CSV or Excel files containing text data, select the column containing the text to analyze, and receive sentiment analysis results classified as positive or negative. The application provides visualizations including word clouds and sentiment distribution charts, and allows users to download the complete analysis results.

## Features

- 📁 **File Upload**: Upload CSV or Excel files with text data
- 🧪 **Test Dataset**: Pre-loaded dataset for testing functionality
- 🧹 **Text Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess text automatically
- 🤖 **BERT Analysis**: Analyze sentiment using a fine-tuned BERT model
- 📊 **Interactive Visualizations**:
  - Sentiment distribution pie chart
  - Word clouds for positive and negative reviews
- 👀 **In-Browser Results**: View sample results directly in the application
- 💾 **Export Results**: Download complete analysis results as CSV

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- pip package manager

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FabioERodrigues/sentiment-analysis-python.git
   cd sentiment-analysis-python
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Starting the Application

1. **Start the Flask server**:
   ```bash
   python app.py

### UI Modifications
Modify the HTML templates in the `templates` directory to customize the user interface.

### Text Processing
Adjust text cleaning and preprocessing in the `clean_text()` function within `app.py`.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Model Loading Error**
- Ensure you have the correct model files in the `models/best_bert_model` directory

**Memory Issues**
- For large datasets, consider processing in batches or increasing server memory

**TensorFlow Warnings**
- The app disables oneDNN optimizations by default to avoid common warnings

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check that all dependencies are properly installed
2. Verify your Python version (3.8+ required)
3. Ensure the BERT model files are in the correct directory
4. Try running with a smaller dataset first
